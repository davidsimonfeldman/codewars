    "Given an array of N integers, you have to find how many times you have to add up the smallest numbers in the array until their Sum becomes greater or equal to K.\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "List size is at least 3.\n",
    "All numbers will be positive.\n",
    "Numbers could occur more than once , (Duplications may exist).\n",
    "Threshold K will always be reachable.\n",

    "minimumSteps({1, 10, 12, 9, 2, 3}, 6)  ==>  return (2)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "We add two smallest elements (1 + 2), their sum is 3 .\n",
    "Then we add the next smallest number to it (3 + 3) , so the sum becomes 6 .\n",
    "Now the result is greater or equal to 6 , Hence the output is (2) i.e (2) operations are required to do this .\n",
    "minimumSteps({8 , 9, 4, 2}, 23)  ==> return (3)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "We add two smallest elements (4 + 2), their sum is 6 .\n",
    "Then we add the next smallest number to it (6 + 8) , so the sum becomes 14 .\n",
    "Now we add the next smallest number (14 + 9) , so the sum becomes 23 .\n",
    "Now the result is greater or equal to 23 , Hence the output is (3) i.e (3) operations are required to do this .\n",
    "minimumSteps({19,98,69,28,75,45,17,98,67}, 464)  ==>  return (8)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "We add two smallest elements (19 + 17), their sum is 36 .\n",
    "Then we add the next smallest number to it (36 + 28) , so the sum becomes 64 .\n",
    "We need to keep doing this until the sum becomes greater or equal to K (464 in this case), which will require 8 Steps .\n",
