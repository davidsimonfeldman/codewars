    "Story\n",
    "Joe Stoy, in his book \"Denotational Semantics\", tells following story:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision which way round the digits run is, of course, mathematically trivial.\n",
    "Indeed, one early British computer had numbers running from right to left (because\n",
    "the spot on an oscilloscope tube runs from left to right, but in serial logic the\n",
    "least significant digits are dealt with first). \n",
    "\n",
    "Turing used to mystify audiences at public lectures when, quite by accident, he would \n",
    "slip into this mode even for decimal arithmetic, and write things like 73+42=16.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next version of the machine was made more conventional simply by crossing the\n",
    "x-deflection wires: this, however, worried the engineers, whose waveforms were all\n",
    "backwards. That problem was in turn solved by providing a little window so that the \n",
    "engineers(who tended to be behind the computer anyway) could view the oscilloscope\n",
    "screen from the back. \n",
    "\n",
    "[C. Strachey - private communication.]\n",
    "You will play the role of the audience and judge on the truth value of Turing's equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "You are given a string s. It's an equation such as \"a+b=c\", where a, b, c are numbers made up of the digits 0 to 9. This includes possible leading or trailing zeros. The equations will not contain any spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine whether s is a valid Turing equation. Return true or false, respectively, in Turing's interpretation, i.e. the numbers being read backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still struggling to understand the task? Look at the following examples ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "For s = \"73+42=16\", the output should be true.\n",
