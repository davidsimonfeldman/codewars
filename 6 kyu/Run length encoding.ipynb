    "Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) \n",
    "are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia\n",
    "Task\n",
    "Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ],\n",
    "such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings.\n",
    "Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:\n",
    "run_length_encoding(\"hello world!\")\n",

    "It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:\n",
